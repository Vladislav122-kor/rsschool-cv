### **About myself**
---
After graduation from the university I got a job as an Assistant of a small company. Now I have been working here for 2 years. But I realised that this job and in general this spheare is not the thing Iâ€™d like to do. I become interested in IT-sphere and started with learning of Java Script on YouTube. It was a little bit difficult and I decided to take a course.
**My personal goal** is to become a *full-fledged frontend developer*.

**My strengths**: 
* perseverance;
* purposefulness;
* desire to learn and develop;
* memorizing a large flow of information.

### **Skills**
___
**I have basic skills of**:
* HTML;
* CSS;
* JS.

**Example of code**:
```
module.exports = function towelSort (matrix) {
    if (matrix) {

        let arr = [];
    
        for (let i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
          if (i % 2 === 0) {
            for (let y = 0; y < matrix[i].length; y ++) {
              arr.push(matrix[i][y]);
            }
          } else {
            for (let y = matrix[i].length - 1; y >= 0; y--) {
              arr.push(matrix[i][y]);
            }
          }
        }
    
        return arr;
    } else {
        return [];
    }
}
```
