### **About myself**
---
After graduation from the university I got a job as an Assistant of a small company. Now I have been working here for 2 years. But I realised that this job and in general this spheare is not the thing Iâ€™d like to do. I become interested in IT-sphere and started with learning of Java Script on YouTube. It was a little bit difficult and I decided to take a course.
**My personal goal** is to become a *full-fledged frontend developer*.

**My strengths**: 
* perseverance;
* purposefulness;
* desire to learn and develop;
* memorizing a large flow of information.
